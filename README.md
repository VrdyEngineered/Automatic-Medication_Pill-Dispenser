# Automatic Medication Dispenser

The Automatic Medication Dispenser is an innovative solution designed to assist individuals in managing complex medication routines efficiently and reliably. This system automates the process of dispensing medications at predefined intervals, significantly benefiting elderly individuals, patients with chronic conditions, and anyone who struggles with remembering or managing their medication schedules.

By integrating modern technologies like Wi-Fi connectivity and a web server interface, the dispenser ensures accurate timing for medication delivery through synchronization with NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers. Its robust design and functionality improve medication adherence, making it a crucial tool in healthcare and treatment success.

## Working

1. **Medication Schedule:**
   - Users can set the time for taking medications via a web interface connected to the dispenser.
   - The device synchronizes with an NTP server to ensure accurate timing for dispensing medications.

2. **Hand Detection and Dispensing:**
   - The **IR sensor** detects the presence of a user's hand.
   - Medication is dispensed only when the sensor detects the hand under the dispenser.
   - If no hand is detected within a predefined time, a **notification is sent** to the caregiver, indicating that the medication was not taken.

3. **Emergency Alert System:**
   - A **push button** is included for emergency situations.
   - When pressed, the dispenser triggers an **LED light** to turn on and sends an **alert message** to the caregiver through a Telegram bot.
   - This feature ensures immediate assistance for the user.

4. **Medication Reminder:**
   - When itâ€™s time to take medication, a **buzzer** is activated to alert the user.
   - The dispenser also displays the notification on the **OLED screen** for added visibility.

5. **Display and Interaction:**
   - An **OLED screen** displays the current medication schedule, alerts, and other status updates, providing clear feedback for the user.
